We removed the unnecessary foreign key (UserID) in the Trip table, since the relationship between User and Trip is already handled through the TripUser table. The TripUser table facilitates the many-to-many relationship between Trip and User by linking users to trips with a composite primary key made of the two foreign keys TripID and UserId. Keeping UserID as a foreign key in the Trip table would have implied a one-to-many relationship, which contradicts our structure. By removing this FK, we ensured that we donâ€™t have unnecessary constraints in the Trip table.

We also added a normalization explanation under the Normalization section. We clarified that our schema adheres to Third Normal Form (3NF). We ensured that each non-key attribute depends only on the primary key and that there are no transitive dependencies across tables. Each table's attributes are fully functionally dependent on its primary key, and composite keys (such as in TripUser) correctly determine all other attributes in the relation. Our design avoids redundancy, making it efficient for relational database operations.
